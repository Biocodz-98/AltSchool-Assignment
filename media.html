      This image describes my research on the use of artificial intelligence in the tech space and how it has contributed immensely to the growth and development of we developers.Artificial intelligence have helped in developing algorithms and models that enable machine learnings and mimic cognitive functions. This involves areas like machine learning (where models are trained on data to make predictions or decisions), natural language processing (where computers can understand and generate human language), and computer vision (where computers can interpret and analyze visual information). These technologies have revolutionized the way we interact with computers and have opened up new possibilities for innovation and creativity in web development. As a software engineer, i am excited about the potential of artificial intelligence to transform the field of web development and create new opportunities for developers to build intelligent and interactive applications. </p> 
      

      <h5>Video Element</h5>

    <p>
      This video shows my favourite sport game (formula 1 car racing).This video features a simple interface with a car that moves
      horizontally across the screen and avoids obstacles to reach the finish
      line. Players can control the car using sterering whereby they navigate through the course without crashing into the obstacles.
      The game is designed to be challenging and engaging, with increasing
      levels of difficulty as the player progresses. This video demonstrates my
      skills in front-end development and my ability to create interactive and
      dynamic web applications. It showcases my creativity and problem-solving
      skills in designing and implementing a fun and entertaining game that
      users can enjoy. As a software engineer, i am passionate about creating
